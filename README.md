# 🚀 Open Source CI/CD Pipeline Automation  
### Technologies: Python (Flask) + React + Machine Learning + Docker + GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates a complete **CI/CD pipeline automation** system using:

- ✅ Python (Flask) for backend logic and automation
- ✅ React for frontend user interface
- ✅ Machine Learning for predictive analytics in CI/CD
- ✅ Docker & Docker Compose for deployment
- ✅ GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. 📦 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js + npm](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Docker & Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- GitHub account

---

## 🔁 Local Development

### 🐍 Backend Setup (Python + Flask)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
````

### ⚛️ Frontend Setup (React)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

### 📦 Build with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Then access:

* **Frontend:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* **Backend API:** [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Logic

A basic placeholder is added for ML predictions. You can replace `ml_model.py` with your own trained models.

---

## 🔄 GitHub Actions CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflow is located in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`.

It includes:

* 🔎 Lint checks
* 🧪 Testing (extendable)
* 🐳 Docker build validation

Auto-deploy with further integration into platforms like Heroku, Vercel, AWS, etc.

---

## 📂 Folder Access & File Imports

* Python backend handles dynamic folder reading and uploads.
* React handles static file rendering and component-based import logic.

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

* 🧠 Advanced ML: Predictive rollback and anomaly detection
* 🔧 Kubernetes support
* 📊 Grafana + Prometheus monitoring
* 🔐 OAuth & JWT Auth for CI pipelines
